# tsupdate daemon configuration
#
# This file configures the tsupdated daemon that automatically checks for
# and applies system updates using the tryboot mechanism for safe rollback.
#
# Copy this file to /boot/firmware/tsupdate.yml to enable automatic updates.

# How often to check for updates (in seconds)
# Default: 3600 (1 hour)
check_interval: 3600

# Include pre-releases when checking for updates
# Set to true to receive beta/pre-release updates
# Default: false
include_prereleases: false

# Optional: Override GitHub repository URL
# If not set, uses SUPPORT_URL from /etc/os-release
# Useful for testing with a different repository
# github_url: "https://github.com/owner/repo"

# Maximum number of recent releases to check for batch updates
# The daemon will search through this many recent releases to find
# an applicable update for the current version
# Default: 5
max_releases: 5

# System uptime threshold before persisting tryboot configuration (in seconds)
# When the daemon starts after a tryboot reboot, it waits until system uptime
# reaches this threshold before persisting the boot configuration.
# This allows time to verify the update worked, regardless of when the daemon starts.
# Default: 600 (10 minutes of uptime)
persist_timeout: 600

# Countdown before initiating tryboot reboot after update (in seconds)
# After successfully applying an update, the daemon notifies users and waits
# this long before rebooting. Users can cancel by sending SIGTERM to the daemon.
# Default: 60 (1 minute)
update_countdown: 60
